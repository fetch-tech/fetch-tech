This means we **DO NOT** get any **PASSWORDS** or any other private information. We only use the name associated with the account in order to create a unique user experience for the logged in user.

### Article Cards

Users can also reply to previous comments. To do so, press the "Reply" button under the comment you would like to reply to, type your comment, and submit it by pressing "Enter" on your keyboard.
